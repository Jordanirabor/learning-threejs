## Nothing especially dramatic. Just trying my hands at the Three JS library. 

I plan to get started with this before checking out WebGL. I have a little bit of experience with 3d, so I understand how shaders, renders, cameras, scenes (and lighting) work enough not to get too lost. 

I suspect the real complexity would be understanding axes from a purely math perspective without the visual axes that come with 3d apps.
